## Responsibilities
* Facilitated data collection on the Joint Polar Satellite System model by developing a python interface that collects and displays water vapor signals in the atmosphere which are used to make weather prediction
*	Developed algorithms on the ATmega328P chip to detect microwave signals and perform digital demodulation
*	Improved data resolution by 200 times by increasing sampling rate and packaging data in chunks to reduce function overhead
*	Added RF wireless data transmission feature that allows the device to collect microwave data on drones


## Leveraged Knowledge
