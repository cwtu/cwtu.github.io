## Description

In this project we used data science techniques to analyze COVID-19 Data provided by [Johns Hopkins' CSSGI](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). Around the time COVID vaccines came out, people were reluctant to get vaccines due to unknown side effects. Our goal was to find out the correlation between vaccination rate and death rate in the United States. We foud out there is a strong negative correlation between these two factors, which means that taking vaccines helps reduce the chance of dieing from COVID-19. We hope the results presented here will encourage more people to get there shots.
